# Image Setup Guide

## Where to Place Your Images

### 1. Logo
- Save your logo image as: `public/images/logo/logo.png`
- The logo you provided should go here

### 2. Hero Section
- Save your hero image as: `public/images/hero/hero.jpg`
- The fashion model image you provided should go here

### 3. Lookbook Images (Optional - for now using placeholders)
- Add 6 images to: `public/images/lookbook/`
- Name them: `look1.jpg`, `look2.jpg`, `look3.jpg`, `look4.jpg`, `look5.jpg`, `look6.jpg`

### 4. Blog Images (Optional - for now using placeholders)
- Add 3 images to: `public/images/blog/`
- Name them: `post1.jpg`, `post2.jpg`, `post3.jpg`

## Quick Setup Steps

1. Save the first image (logo) to: `public/images/logo/logo.png`
2. Save the second image (hero) to: `public/images/hero/hero.jpg`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

The website will work with just these two images. The lookbook and blog images are optional and can be added later.
